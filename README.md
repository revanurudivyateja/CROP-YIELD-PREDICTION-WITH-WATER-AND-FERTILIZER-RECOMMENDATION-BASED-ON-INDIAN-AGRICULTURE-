## CROP YIELD PREDICTION WITH WATER AND FERTILIZER RECOMMENDATION BASED ON INDIAN AGRICULTURE
A web based application to predict the crop yield
## About
In Indian economy and employment agriculture plays major role. The most common problem faced by the Indian farmers is they do not opt crop based on the necessity of soil, as a result they face serious setback in productivity. This problem can be addressed through precision agriculture. This method takes three parameters into consideration, viz: soil characteristics, soil types and crop recommendation data collection based on these parameters suggesting the farmer suitable crop to be cultivated.
## Features
Analyzes the Crop yield with Simple user interface
## Requirements
Data Requirements Hardware & Software Requirements Skills & Knowledge Requirements Project Steps Important Considerations

## Result
•	As our farmers presently are not using technology in their farming practices, they are lagging behind in their farming approaches.
•	Hence, we have made this project so as to encourage farmers to use the current technology instead of relying on old methods.
•	Growing a crop requires a lot of knowledge and insight into many things such as the contents of soil, temperature of the place, pH of soil etc. and hence it would make sense for the farmer to adopt to newer technologies as it would make his life easier.
•	Farmers make a mistake by cultivating the same crops year after year without experimenting with different varieties. They add fertilizers randomly without understanding the inferior quality or quantity. The paper aims to discover the best model for crop prediction, which can help farmers decide the type of crop to grow based on the climatic conditions and nutrients present in the soil.
